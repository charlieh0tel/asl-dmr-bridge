# Claude Instructions for asl-dmr-bridge

## Critical Rules

- Be extremely concise; sacrifice grammar for concision.
- Use built-in tools for file operations.
- Use globs for file search, grep for content search, read for viewing files.
- Do not request grep/sed/fd/find/ls/cat or similar CLI tools when you
  already have these capabilities built-in.
- Read code before modifying it.  Understand existing patterns and
  context before proposing changes.
- Always list unresolved questions at end.
- Keep documention (.md files) up to date with code changes.


## Revision Control

- Do not add Claude attribution to commit messages.
- Do not commit without permission.
- PRs should generally be comprised of one functional change; suggest
  making a commit before moving onto something unrelated.
- All tests must pass before committing.
- Never use -a to commit; always enumerate the files.


## Programming Rules

- Prefer ASCII in all code and user-facing strings (logs, CLI output,
  error messages).  Ask before using Unicode.
- Prefer consistency above most other concerns.
- Do not add trivial, obvious or redundant comments.
- Be DRY.
- Avoid magic constants.
- Only comment unintiutive or hard to understand code.
- Always comment data structures.
- Don't abbreviate by dropping letters from the middle of a word.
  Truncation (cutting from the end) is OK: `repeater` can shorten
  to `rep` or `repeat` but not to `rpt`.  Domain acronyms / wire-
  protocol terms are fine -- `dmr`, `rs`, `bptc`, `rptc`, `tg`,
  `cc`, `rx`, `tx`, `agl`, `pep`.


## Rust Rules

- Use the latest stable Rust edition.
- Always run `cargo fmt` after changes and before commits.
- Always run `cargo clippy` after major changes and always before commits.
- Run tests with `cargo test`.
- Always use the narrowest visibility possible.
- Avoid public by default.
- Prefer `#[expect(lint, reason = "...")]` over `#[allow(lint)]`. If
  you must use `allow`, add `// [TODO] @<developer>: fix allow lint`.
- Use item-level imports, not nested crate/module imports.
- Prefer `use` statements at module top over inline imports.
- Avoid mutable variables when possible.  Prefer new bindings or shadows.
- Never re-export.  Use individual use statements where needed instead
  of `pub use` or `pub(crate) use`.
- Never employ a wildcard `use` statement on an enum when trying to
  shorten match arms.
- Use the newtype idiom as appropriate.
- Do not use `anyhow` in library crates at all; use typed errors via
  `thiserror` instead.  `anyhow` is for binaries only.
- Do not use `unsafe` without asking.
- When adding dependencies, use `cargo add` to ensure we install the
  latest version of dependencies.
