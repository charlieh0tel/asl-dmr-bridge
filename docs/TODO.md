# TODO

Tracked-but-deferred work.  Each entry is sized roughly: a single
line of context + the rough effort + the trigger that would make it
worth picking up.

## Maybe

Plausible but value-uncertain; defer until a real-world need
appears.

- **Investigate the v1.8.0 SIGSEGV.**  Crash hit on the first RX
  header on arm64 with `backend = "neural"` (decode delegated to
  dynarmic at the time).  Print line was dynarmic's signal handler
  `Unhandled SIGSEGV at pc 0x...`, suggesting a fault outside JIT
  memory regions.  Coredump was not captured at the time.  Trigger:
  any dynarmic-on-arm64 crash.  Capture core via systemd-coredump
  and follow the backtrace.
